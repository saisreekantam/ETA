## Simulation Data

### Mode 1 Simulations

The `simulations/mode_1/` directory contains comprehensive simulation data for Mode 1 operations:

#### Normal Operations
- **`mode1_normal_50.xlsx`**: 50 hours of normal Mode 1 operations
- **`mode1_normal_500.xlsx`**: 500 hours of normal Mode 1 operations

#### Fault Scenarios
The `faults/` subdirectory contains fault simulation data with:
- **21 different fault types** representing various process disturbances and equipment failures
- **5 simulation batches** for each fault type (providing statistical variability)
- **File naming convention**: `mode1_{fault_number}_{batch_number}.xlsx`
  - Fault numbers: 1-21 (corresponding to the 21 standard Tennessee Eastman faults)
  - Batch numbers: 1-5 (five independent simulation runs per fault)

### Mode 3 and Mode 4 Simulations

- **`mode3_normal_50.xlsx`**: 50 hours of normal Mode 3 operations
